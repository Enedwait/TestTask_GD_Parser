# Test Task [GD] - Parser
This is a test assignment from ***ChillBase*** game dev company associated with the **Tech GD** role. The one to parse the balance data, countries and dates accordingly. And this is also the brand new returning experience of JS coding through some years for me.

## Content
1) Simple **index.html** file for testing.
2) JavaScript **parser.js** parser is retrieving balance data from the hard-coded public Google Sheet (copy of the original one provided by ***ChillBase***, defined as *sheetID* on the top of .js file), performs all the required manipulations to collect and process the data and then outputs the result back to the **index.html** and also to console.

## Technology
1) **Visual Studio Code**
2) **Live Server** extension (for VS Code)
